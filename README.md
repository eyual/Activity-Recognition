#Sensor Data Mining and Activity Recognition Using Cellphone Accelerometer

Project Description
-------------------

This project uses cell phone accelerometers to perform activity recognition, a task which involves identifying 
the physical activity a user is performing which include walking, jogging (or running), sitting and standing.

Different data samples of accelerometer values of various activities thorugh multiple test cases was captured through
an *Android App* which was studied and then used to design a heuristic which could recognize activitites. The Android app lets the user to upload the collected data sample onto a server machine which runs the program and provide results.

Technologies Used
-----------------

* An **Android** application which uses cellphone's tri axis accelerometer and records sensor data
* **R** was used for studying data patterns as well as for designing the program to recognize activities
* A **Java** based web server was created to send the captured data from the app directly to the processing side.
